#Hello! This is my bio... I guess

---
So, when I code, it generally is not usable code that someone else would want to have on their desktop and use even once in a while, but I have some personal things that I like to use.

  <summary>Something about me...</summary>
  Well, there is not a lot to talk about. I am 14, I code on my Mac, which is also my daily driver (man, games just suck on it) and I know a few programming languages:
  - HTML & CSS (some not very high-level knowledge, but I can make a website or two if I try)
  - C - About a year ago, I started to learn how to code in C and I guess I am better at it than I was before
  - Python - I know some stuff in Python but I don't code large projects in it, I generally use it to my advantage of not paying for autoclickers when playing games, or some more complex inputs
  yeah that's about it.....
