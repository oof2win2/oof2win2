# Hello! This is my bio... I guess

---
So, when I code, it generally is not usable code that someone else would want to have on their desktop and use even once in a while, but I have some personal things that I like to use.

  <summary>Something about me...</summary>

  Well, there is not a lot to talk about. I am 15, I code on my Mac, which is also my daily driver (man, games just suck on it) and I know a few programming languages:
  * JS - I mainly work on [AwF-Bot](https://github.com/DistroByte/AwF-Bot) in JS, but I find it as a pretty good language. It is the language I am fairly certain that I know best (from the three I have here)
  * C - About two years ago, I started to learn how to code in C and I guess I am better at it than I was before
  * Python - I know some stuff in Python but I don't code large projects in it, I generally use it to my advantage of not paying for autoclickers when playing games, or some more complex inputs
  yeah that's about it.....

  I also have some things I like. Here are a few:
  - Programming
  - Playing videogames (Factorio is one of the best, if not THE best)
  - Binging Netflix
