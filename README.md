# Hello! This is my bio... I guess

---
So, when I code, it generally is not usable code that someone else would want to have on their desktop and use even once in a while, but I have some personal things that I like to use.

  <summary>Something about me...</summary>

  Well, there is not a lot to talk about. I am 14, I code on my Mac, which is also my daily driver (man, games just suck on it) and I know a few programming languages:
  * HTML & CSS (some not very high-level knowledge, but I can make a website or two if I try)
  * C - About a year ago, I started to learn how to code in C and I guess I am better at it than I was before
  * Python - I know some stuff in Python but I don't code large projects in it, I generally use it to my advantage of not paying for autoclickers when playing games, or some more complex inputs
  yeah that's about it.....

  I also have some things I like. Here are a few:
  - Programming
  - Playing videogames (Factorio is one of the best, if not THE best)
  - Binging Netflix

  <summary>My Projects</summary>
  - filiptronicek/github-stuff - This is made with my friends from Protab2020, is finished, but it is just a bunch of scripts for very specific things
  - electronTimeApp - Styling could/should be added, app could be published to Electron
  - snake - This is still WIP, will not be published as a stand-alone app, rather will be compiled by the user (if there will be any) and then ran
  - brazzers-bot - This is also WIP, but it hopefully will be added somewhere for end users to upload images and this to do it's magic on a website or something
